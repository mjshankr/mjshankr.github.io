  description: I joined Paolucci Group in the Fall of 2020. My research focuses on understanding the kinetics and mechanism of N2O formation on supported metal catalysts. I did my Masters in Chemical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, where I explored the dried droplet patterns of human serum albumin, under the guidance of Prof. Sunando DasGupta. Outside of research, I enjoy cycling, swimming, painting and reading.

  description: I joined the Paolucci Group in the summer of 2023, focusing my research on the effects of sulfur exposure on Cu speciation and ammonia storage in Cu-ion exchanged chabazite (CHA) zeolite. This research is motivated by reducing NOx emissions through the diesel aftertreatment system – SCR. During my undergraduate studies, I immersed myself in sustainable energy research, honing practical skills through assistant teaching and research roles. Additionally, I acquired valuable industry experience by serving as a Process Engineer for seven months at an herbicide manufacturing company during my year-long internship. Research aside, I enjoy nature, especially the trails around Charlottesville, and unwinding with friends and family over board games.

  description: I joined the Paolucci Lab in fall of 2023. My research uses molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical situations to study the effect of local electric fields on catalytic active sites in zeolites. I received my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Cornell University, where I researched pulsed electrochemical CO2 reduction in Prof. Tobias Hanrath’s lab. Outside of research, I enjoy drawing, painting, playing my guitar, fostering rescue cats, and training/rehabilitating birds of prey.

  description: I joined the Paolucci Lab in the fall of 2023. My research applies molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning-based potentials to study noble metal nanoparticles' surface and subsurface structure evolution during catalytic oxidation reactions. During my undergraduate, I explored the physicochemical properties of crude oil, liquid fuels, and biofuels in the Crude Oil and Derivatives Lab. Later, I designed directional and horizontal well trajectories as a Well Planning intern in Sperry Drilling Services, Halliburton. Post-graduation, I joined the area of Project Management for Workover and Well Service operations. Outside of research, I enjoy dancing salsa, cooking, watching shows, and traveling.

  description: As a member of the Paolucci group (since the fall of 2024), I’m studying nanoparticle encapsulated zeolite systems using computational methods. I first dipped my toes into the field of computational catalysis in undergrad, where I joined Professor Aleksandra Vojvodic’s group (during the pandemic) and studied the activity and stability of catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction. In my free time, I like to watch random clips on YouTube, study foreign languages, and walk in new and old areas. You can ask me about anything but definitely ask me about recommendations on things to do/places to go in Japan.

  description: I joined the Paolucci Group in the Summer of 2024 with a focus on solvent effects in zeolites. One focus of my undergraduate research was creating a baseline for quantum mechanical transition state theories. The other project was centered on molecular dynamics simulations to ascertain properties of a novel interatomic potential. When I'm not working, I like to take walks and teach myself guitar (though I haven't made much progress).
